# Simple_LLM_Project
This workspace contains all the code and data I had to 
create while going through Sebastian Raschka's book
[Build a Large Language Model from Scratch](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch)


This is not a reproduction of the book and comments are for my eyes only and may not always make sense to you.
I'd suggest if you are curious go through your own journey of creating an LLM from Scratch. 

PS: I have not arranged things into packages yet. Will do that as time permits
