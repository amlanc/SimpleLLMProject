## This workspace contains all the code and data I had to create while going through Sebastian Raschka's book [Building a Large Language Model \(From Scratch\)](https://livebook.manning.com/book/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch/title  "Building a Large Language Model") to understand each of the components. 

This is not a reproduction of the book and the comments in code are for my eyes only and may not always make sense to you. I'd suggest if you are curious go through your own effort of creating an LLM from Scratch. Its an incredible journey.

PS: I have not arranged things into packages yet. Will do that as time permits
